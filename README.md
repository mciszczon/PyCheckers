# PyCheckers

English draughts (aka checkers) web-based game written in Python 3 and Flask.

_This readme document will be extended heavily as the time goes._

## Read more

If you want to read more about the process of creating PyCheckers, then I am writing extensively about it on my Steemit blog.
Here's a list of links to all the articles there:

### [#1 — Introduction](https://steemit.com/programming/@mciszczon/en-pycheckers-1-introduction)

Here I talk about the origin of the project, why I do it, how I plan to do it and so on.
I also describe English draughts rules extensively for those who do not know them.

### [#2 — Creating the base application](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@mciszczon/4yxa9k-en-pycheckers-2-creating-the-base-application)

Here we learn how to set up a development environment for Flask.
Then we will create a very simple base application with Flask, so that next time we can start creating the game itself.
