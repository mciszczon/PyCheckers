# PyCheckers

English draughts (aka checkers) web-based game written in Python 3 and Flask.

_This readme document will be extended heavily as the time goes._

## Read more

If you want to read more about the process of creating PyCheckers, then I am writing extensively about it on my Steemit blog.
Here's a list of links to all the articles there:

### [#1 — Introduction](https://steemit.com/programming/@mciszczon/en-pycheckers-1-introduction)

Here I talk about the origin of the project, why I do it, how I plan to do it and so on.
I also describe English draughts rules extensively for those who do not know them.

### [#2 — Creating the base application](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@mciszczon/4yxa9k-en-pycheckers-2-creating-the-base-application)

Here we learn how to set up a development environment for Flask.
Then we will create a very simple base application with Flask, so that next time we can start creating the game itself.

### [#3 — Dynamic board with turns and selectable pieces](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@mciszczon/en-pycheckers-3-dynamic-board-with-turns-and-selectable-pieces)

In third part I have created some base Classes for the game, and using those classes I was able to generate a dynamic chessboard.
Then I allowed user to select black or white piece—determined by turn.

### [#4 — Moves and captures, multiple games, refractoring the code](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@mciszczon/en-pycheckers-3-moves-and-captures-multiple-games-refractoring-the-code)

Here I took care of a basic refractorization of the code, so that it's easier to maintain in the future. Also, multiple games can now be started and be played simultaneously.
About the game itself, I have allowed pieces to be moved along the board and then implemented captures.
This means that PyCheckers now have the very basic game mechanisms ready: selecting, moving, capturing.
